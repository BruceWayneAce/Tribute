    Steve Jobs
    I am so very sad to know that Mr. Jobs has died. My deepest and sincerest <br>
     sympathy to his family and his co-workers. He was a <br>
      great man of extraordinary vision. <br><br>

      <p> <b id="sadd"> We are SAD!!!! </b> <br>
Dear Family, Friends and Colleagues of Steve Jobs, My son who is only 11 years <br>
 old had tears in his eyes and covered his face when he heard the sad news. <br>
  He loves, understands and very interested in APPLE technology!!! He always <br>
   watched Steve Jobs' "Apple Event", and he wants to know everything <br>
    about Apple. He knows the story of Steve Job's life! If we ask something <br>
     about the operation of the Apple Computer or iPhone he answers our question. <br>
      This summer as we were coming home from a vacation from Northern California,<br>
       our son asked us to stop in Cupertino, just to see the Apple Headquarters. <br>
        We are grateful for Steve Jobs! Our hearts are broken! <br>
         We are wishing the best to His Family! </p>

       <p> I'm Devastated
        I'm a fan, follower, friend and lover of all things Apple. Steve Jobs <br>
         was a hero to the geek in all of us; a brilliant visionary who carried <br>
          his convictions to completion. So sorry to hear he wasn't able to beat <br>
           his illness, the world has lost a bright flame, a voice who gave us <br>
            so much. I have been able to remain self employed in a home office <br>
             because Steve Jobs gave me my freedom: with computers and other <br>
              innovations that are fast and easy to use. I fell in love with my <br>
               first Mac and I've never looked back. Steve Jobs changed the world <br>
                and he will be missed. His fire burned out today, but we will keep <br>
                 the flame burning with our loyalty and our hope for the future of Apple. <br>
                  And in the end, it isn't about money, or things, or anything. My condolences <br>
                   to all of you who worked with and knew this fearless leader. </p>

    <div class="sad3">

     <p>  to one of our nation's greatest
        You are a shining example to the world of what hard work, perseverance <br>
         and love for people can produce. In a world filled <br>
         with "greed is good" and "anything goes" philosophies, you were <br>
          a rare example of a man with integrity. Rest in peace and Thank you. </p>
